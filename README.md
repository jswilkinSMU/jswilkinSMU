# 👋 Hi, I'm Jacob Wilkin

🎮 Game Programmer | 🎓 SMU Guildhall Master's Student | 🧠 Systems Designer

I'm a game programmer with a background in computer science and animation, currently pursuing my Master’s in Interactive Technology at SMU Guildhall.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Build core gameplay mechanics and real-time procedural systems
- Design AI-driven behaviors and dynamic environments
- Create custom tools that empower designers and streamline workflows
- Approach development from both analytical and artistic perspectives

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills

- **Languages:** C++, C#, Python
- **Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Focus Areas:** Gameplay Programming, AI, Engine Development, Tool Creation
- **Soft Skills:** Collaboration, Communication, Creative Problem Solving

## 🎮 Projects

### 🕹️ Starship *(Solo Project)*
- Developed using a personal game engine
- Focused on procedural systems and core gameplay mechanics/physics

### 🚀 Runner

### 🧠 Escape Through the Wire *(Team Project)*
- Stealth-strategy game where the player acts as the “man in the chair”
- Designed hand-drawn path mechanics, jamming fields, and toggle-based interactions
- Technologies: Unity | C# | UE Blueprints
- Role: Lead Programmer
- Team Size: 4 Developers

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

I believe great games emerge from the intersection of **systemic depth** and **player intuition**. My design philosophy centers on:

- **Empowering player agency** through mechanics that reward experimentation and strategic thinking
- **Designing tools for designers**, enabling rapid iteration and creative freedom
- **Balancing complexity with clarity**, so systems feel rich but never overwhelming
- **Creating emotional resonance** through gameplay, not just narrative

Games should feel like living systems—responsive, expressive, and full of possibility.

## 🚀 Future Goals

As I continue to grow as a developer, I’m aiming to:

- **Join a studio** where I can contribute to gameplay and systems programming on ambitious titles
- **Develop my own engine** with modular AI and procedural generation frameworks
- **Explore emerging tech** like machine learning in game design and player modeling
- **Mentor junior developers** and foster inclusive, collaborative team environments
- **Speak at conferences** and share insights on tool creation and systems thinking
